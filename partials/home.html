<p>When we build a website these days, there's a 110% chance that it's got some form of JavaScript on it. Whether it's a full framework, for animations, to trigger a popup or as a tracking script, JavaScript is all around us.</p>
<p>But what if I told you that you didn't have to use JavaScript at all? Not even as a build process? Thanks to updates in browser technologies, there's now a plethora of native browser features that allow building modern, functional websites, sans JavaScript.</p>
